								<subsect><designator>(a)</designator> In reaching a decision on a

				(Government Code Section
				<codecitation statecd="CA" sessionyear="2021" datatype="S" title="California Government Code"><codesec>11400</codesec></codecitation>
				et seq.), the Dental Board of California shall consider the
				disciplinary guidelines entitled "Dental Board of California
				Disciplinary Guidelines With Model Language", revised 08/30/2010
				which are hereby incorporated by reference. Deviation from these
				guidelines and orders, including the standard terms of probation, is
				appropriate where the Dental Board of California, in its sole
				discretion, determines that the facts of the particular case warrant
				such deviation - for example: the presence of mitigating factors; the
				age of the case; evidentiary problems.</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(b)</designator> Notwithstanding subsection (a),
				the Board shall use the uniform standards for substance-abusing
				licensees as provided in Section 1018.01, without deviation, for each
				individual determined to be a substance-abusing licensee.</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(c)</designator> Notwithstanding the
				disciplinary guidelines, any proposed decision issued by an
				Administrative Law Judge in accordance with Chapter 5 (commencing
				with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the
				Government Code that contains any findings of fact that: 
				<subsect><designator>(1)</designator> the licensee engaged in any act
				of sexual contact with a patient, client or customer; or,</subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(2)</designator> the licensee has been convicted
				of or committed a sex offense, shall contain an order revoking the
				license. The proposed decision shall not contain an order staying the
				revocation of the license or placing the licensee on
				probation.</subsect></subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(d)</designator>
				For the purposes of this section, "sexual contact" has the same

				  within 15 days of becoming aware of the misrepresentation or
				  omission, object to the Office of Administrative Hearings, clearly

									<para>Parties shall have the following obligations with

									<subsect><designator>(a)</designator> Discovery (including inspection
				  and production of documents and records, depositions,
				  interrogatories, admissions, etc.) by agreement of the Parties is
				  encouraged. For this purpose it is the duty of the Parties or their
				  counsel to communicate with each other before initiating discovery to
				  determine whether a reasonable agreement for discovery can be made.
				  This subsection does not limit or modify the rights and obligations
				  of the Parties with respect to discovery set forth in Section
				  <codecitation statecd="CA" sessionyear="2021" datatype="S" title="California Code of Civil Procedure"><codesec>1283.05</codesec></codecitation>

									<subsect><designator>(b)</designator> Inspection and production of

				  discovery.</subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(c)</designator>
				  Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2030 and 2033 of the Code
				  of Civil Procedure, all original documents relating to
				  interrogatories and requests for admissions and all notices of the
				  taking of deposition and inspection and production of documents shall
				  be filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings and copies shall
				  be served on all Parties to the Arbitration.</subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(d)</designator> On request of any Party made
				  not less than 30 days prior to the hearing on the merits, each Party
				  shall notify the other Parties in writing of the identity and current
				  address of each expert witness to be presented as a witness at the
				  hearing and a brief narrative statement of the qualifications of such
				  witnesses and the general substance of the testimony which the
				  witness is expected to give. At the same time, the Parties shall also
				  exchange all written reports prepared by such witnesses and each
				  Party shall have a reasonable opportunity to depose such witnesses.
				  The Arbitrator may permit a Party to call an expert witness not
				  included on the list upon a showing of good cause.</subsect>

								<subsect><designator>(a)</designator> In conducting the SRIA required
				by Section 11346.3(c) of the code, an agency shall use an economic
				impact method and approach that has all of the following
				capabilities: <subsect><designator>(1)</designator> Can estimate the
				total economic effects of changes due to regulatory policies over a
				multi-year time period. </subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(2)</designator> Can generate California
				economic variable estimates such as personal income, employment by
				economic sector, exports and imports, and gross state product, based
				on inter-industry relationships that are equivalent in structure to
				the Regional Industry Modeling System published by the Bureau of
				Economic Analysis. </subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(3)</designator>
				Can produce (to the extent possible) quantitative estimates of
				economic variables that address or facilitate the quantitative or
				qualitative estimation of the following: 
				<subsect><designator>(A)</designator> The creation or elimination of
				jobs within the state; </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(B)</designator> The creation of new businesses
				or the elimination of existing businesses within the state;
				</subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(C)</designator> The competitive
				advantages or disadvantages for businesses currently doing business
				within the state; </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(D)</designator>
				The increase or decrease of investment in the state; </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(E)</designator> The incentives for innovation
				in products, materials, or processes; and </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(F)</designator> The benefits of the
				regulations, including but not limited to benefits to the health,
				safety, and welfare of California residents, worker safety, and the
				state's environment and quality of life, among any other benefits
				identified by the agency. </subsect>
									</subsect>
								</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(b)</designator> The department's most current
				publicly available economic and demographic projections, which may be
				found on the department's website, shall be used unless the
				department approves the agency's written request to use a different
				projection for a specific proposed major regulation. Such approval
				shall be made on a case-by-case basis. An agency that anticipates
				that it will take more than one year to develop a major regulation is
				encouraged to work with the department in determining the most
				appropriate projections to use.</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(c)</designator> Costs and benefits shall be
				separately identified for different groups of agencies, businesses
				and individuals if the impact of the regulation will differ
				significantly among identifiable groups.</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(d)</designator> The agency shall compare
				regulatory alternatives with a baseline that reflects the anticipated
				behavior of individuals and businesses in the absence of the proposed
				major regulation and shall identify the baseline it used.</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(e)</designator> In comparing proposed
				regulatory alternatives with an established baseline, an agency
				should consider including the following in its analysis:
				<subsect><designator>(1)</designator> A description of feasible
				alternatives to the proposed major regulation and the rationale for
				choosing the proposed major regulation over the other alternatives
				considered. This description should also include: 
				<subsect><designator>(A)</designator> An explanation of how the need
				for the proposed major regulation affects the selection of regulatory
				alternatives; </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(B)</designator> An
				evaluation of the legal and statutory constraints that limit the
				selection of regulatory alternatives. </subsect>
									</subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(2)</designator> Whenever possible, at least two
				alternatives should be compared to the proposed major regulation,
				including: <subsect><designator>(A)</designator> An alternative that
				could achieve additional benefits beyond those associated with the
				proposed major regulation; and </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(B)</designator> A next-best alternative that
				would not yield the same level of benefits associated with the
				proposed major regulation, or is less likely to yield the same level
				of benefits. </subsect>
									</subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(3)</designator> A comparison of the
				cost-effectiveness of different alternatives. 
				<subsect><designator>(A)</designator> Both total and incremental
				benefits and costs should be estimated. Incremental benefits and
				costs are the differences between the estimates associated with the
				alternatives considered. </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(B)</designator> Whenever possible, final rather
				than intermediate outcomes should be used as measures of
				effectiveness. </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(C)</designator> In
				cases where the proposed major regulation addresses more than one
				measure of effectiveness, weights should be applied to different
				categories of effects. </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(D)</designator> The uncertainties associated
				with the estimates should be discussed. </subsect>
									</subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(4)</designator> If there are significant
				differences between the incidence or timing of costs and benefits of
				a regulation, distributional effects should be addressed, including
				how the effects of the regulation are distributed, for example, by
				industry, income, race, sex, or geography, and how the effects are
				distributed over time. </subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(5)</designator> The assumptions, analytical
				methods, and data used in the analysis should be documented. 
				<subsect><designator>(A)</designator> To the extent possible, the
				analysis should rely on peer-reviewed literature. </subsect>
										<subsect><designator>(B)</designator> The source for all original
				information should be documented. </subsect>
									</subsect>
								</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(f)</designator> An analysis of estimated
				changes in behavior by businesses and/or individuals in response to
				the proposed major regulation shall be conducted and, if feasible, an
				estimate made of the extent to which costs or benefits are retained
				within the business and/or by individuals or passed on to others,
				including customers, employees, suppliers and owners.</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(g)</designator> For each assessment of the
				value of benefits of the proposed major regulation required by
				section 11346.3(c)(1)(F) of the code, the agency shall describe the
				applied analytical methods and data sources used and the results of
				that analysis. <subsect><designator>(1)</designator> The agency's
				assessment may rely on current and (if applicable) projected market
				transaction data where a market exists that can directly reveal the
				quantity or monetary value of a projected benefit of the proposed
				major regulation. </subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(2)</designator>
				The agency may use an indirect approach (e.g., use values derived
				from related markets) in cases where the value of the benefits can be
				inferred from actual choices made by individuals in related markets.
				The assessment should rely on current and (if applicable) projected
				market transaction data. </subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(3)</designator> The agency may use a direct
				approach (e.g. use values from surveys), estimating the value of the
				benefits based on hypothetical choices made by individuals responding
				to a survey. </subsect>
									<subsect><designator>(4)</designator> The
				agency may estimate the value of the benefits based upon an existing
				study of another regulatory policy with similar subject or physical
				characteristics. This estimate should describe how the agency took
				into account the differences in the characteristics (such as time
				span, specific benefits to value, population, and other
				socio-economic factors) between the study and the proposed major
				regulation. </subsect>
								</subsect>
								<subsect><designator>(h)</designator> In assessing the effects of a
				regulatory proposal on the General Fund and special funds of the
				state and affected local government agencies attributable to the
				proposed major regulation, including the cost of enforcement and
				compliance to the agency, an agency shall follow the Department of
				Finance instructions in the State Administrative Manual sections
				6601, 6602, and 6604 through 6616.</subsect>
